 \LHead{Motivation}

Climate change is likely to increase average daily temperatures and the frequency of heat waves, which can reduce meat and milk production (Key and Sneeringer 2014)

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=80mm]{Graphics/TempOverTime.pdf}
\caption{Average temperature (C) between 1996 and 2006 in the South-West of France}
\end{figure}

Managing the risk of such intense events may influence dairy farmers' production decisions, and their risk preferences.
The idea is to study precisely how a realized extreme event affects farmers' risk preferences.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] {\color{DarkBlue} \textbf{Research questions:}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[{\color{DarkBlue} $\bullet$}] {\color{DarkBlue} \textit{Is there a change observed in dairy farmers' risk preferences over time?}}
    \item[{\color{DarkBlue} $\bullet$}]  {\color{DarkBlue} \textit{Do extreme climatic events modify dairy farmers' risk aversion?}}
    \item[{\color{DarkBlue} $\bullet$}]  {\color{DarkBlue} \textit{Is a nonparametric approach adapted/tractable to answer these question ?}}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\LHead{Analytical framework}

 The usual way of investigating the production risk into a {\color{MonStabilo}stochastic production function} is to consider a Just and Pope \citeyear{Just}, \citeyear{Just2} production function given by:
\begin{equation} \label{JustPope}
y=f(x,z)+g(x,z)\epsilon
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the observed output quantity, $x$ is a vector of variable input quantities $(x_1, . . . , x_J)$,
$z$ is a vector of quasi-fixed input quantities $(z_1, . . . , z_K)$, $f(.)$ is the mean production
function, $g(.)$ is the production risk function. The random term $\epsilon$ represents a {\color{MonStabilo}weather shock} that may affect output, exogenous to farmer's action, with zero mean and a variance of one.

The dairy farmer's optimisation programme is written as follows:
\begin{equation*}
Max_{x} \; \;  EU(\pi) = EU\bigg(pf(x,z)+pg(x,z) \epsilon -cx\bigg)
\end{equation*}
where $p$ denotes the milk production price, $c$ the vector of variable input prices.\\


We get the the following first-order conditions (FOC):
\begin{equation*}
E\bigg[U'(\pi)\big(pf_j(x,z)+pg_j(x,z) \epsilon -c_j\big)\bigg]=0 \; \; \;  \forall j=1,..., J
\end{equation*}

where $U'(.)$ is the marginal utility of profit, $f_j$ and $g_j$ denote the first derivatives of the mean production function and the risk production function, respectively, with respect to the $j$-th variable input. Rewritten in the following way:

\begin{equation}\label{RiskTheo}
 pf_j(x,z) - c_j - \theta(.) pg_j(x,z)=0 \; \; \; \forall j=1,..., J
\end{equation}

where $\theta(x,z,p,c) =  \frac{E[U'(\pi)\epsilon]}{E[U'(\pi)]}$ is the {\color{MonStabilo}risk preference function}.

Using a first-order polynomial approximation (see Kumbhakar and Tsionas \citeyear{KumbhakarTsionas}) the risk preference function $\theta(.)$ takes the following form:
\begin{equation}
\theta(.)=-AR(\pi)\sigma_{\pi}
\end{equation}

where $AR(\pi)=\frac{-U''(\pi)}{U'(\pi)}$ is the {\color{MonStabilo}Arrow-Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion} and $\sigma_{\pi}^2=var(\pi)=p^2(g(x,z))^2$.

\LHead{Nonparametric estimation}

We follow the multi-step procedure proposed by Kumbhakar and Tsionas \citeyear{KumbhakarTsionas} for estimating  the mean production function $f(\cdot)$ , and the production risk function $g(\cdot)$ leading to the risk preference function $\theta(\cdot)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item In a first stage, we estimate mean production function $f(\cdot)$ :
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & f(x,z)+g(x,z)\epsilon \\
  & = & f(w)+\nu
\end{eqnarray*}
where $w$ denotes the vector of all variable inputs (including variable inputs and quasi-fixed inputs), and $\nu$ is the error term. The function $f()$ can then be estimated by $\widehat{f()}$ using classical nonparametric regression methods.
\begin{equation*}
 \widehat{f}(w) =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \; K\left( \frac{W_i -w}{h}\right) }
    {\sum_{i=1}^n K\left( \frac{W_i - w}{h}\right)}
\end{equation*}
Where $K()$ is a multivariate kernel function and $h$ is a vector of bandwidths associated to the set of explanatory variables $w$. Since we are interested mainly by the derivatives of $f()$, we use the {\color{MonStabilo}local linear nonparametric estimation }procedure proposed by Li and Racine \citeyear{Li2004} allowing simultaneous estimation of both the function and its derivatives $f_j(w)$ for $j=1, \ldots, J$.


\item In the second stage, we compute the sample residuals $\widehat{e_i} = Y_i - \widehat{f}(W_i)$ of the first stage regression model.

Then we use a local linear nonparametric estimator of $e_i$ (resp. $e_i^2)$ on $w$ to compute the estimator of the  mean risk production function  $\widehat{g}(w)$  and its derivatives $\widehat{g _j}(w)$ for $j=1, \ldots, J$ (resp. the variance $\widehat{\sigma^2}(w)$).

\item Once the mean production function and the mean risk production function and their derivatives have been estimated, we compute the  risk preference function $\theta(\cdot)$ using the FOC in equation \ref{RiskTheo}.

\begin{equation}\label{thetahat}
\hat{\theta}(\cdot) = \frac{1}{J} \sum_{j=1}^{J} \Bigl[ \frac{{\hat f_j(X)}-c_j/p}{-{\hat g_j(X)}}\Bigr]
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}

\LHead{{\large Data}}

The sample consists of 2588 dairy farmers from six regions in the Southwestern of France. The period covered is from 1996-2006. Thus total number of observations is 28458. The farm-level data were complemented with weather data for each region from the French Meteorogical Institute.\\

\LHead{{\large Nonparametric estimation implementation}}


We use up-to-date nonparametric estimation techniques to compute the ingredients needed for estimating $\theta (\cdot)$ according to equation \ref{thetahat}. As in any nonparametric estimation, the choice of the bandwidth a is a crucial element in the practical implementation. For both the computation of $\widehat{f}(\cdot)$, $\widehat{g}(\cdot)$ and $\widehat{\sigma^2}(\cdot)$, we opted for the computation of {\color{MonStabilo}cross-validated bandwidths} for each each year so that the local linear estimators are automatically balanced between bias and variance. We choose higher order continuous kernels implemented in the R package \textit{np} (Hayfield and Racine \citeyear{Hayfield2008}) %\\

We use another interesting feature of the recent development in nonparametric estimation technique by using {\color{MonStabilo} Kernel Regression Significance Tests}. We run this test based on the work by Racine, Hart, and Li \citeyear{Racine2006} for each year and derive significance of each explanatory variable (399 bootstraps). Hence,  we confirm the significance observed in running a linear regression (t-test). %\\

Finally, we also check \textit{ex-post} whether the risk production function estimated where satisfying classical production function features ($ f' > 0$ and $f'' <0$).
%One possible extension would be to estimate $f(\cdot)$ under shape constrains (see Du, Parmeter and Racine \citeyear{Du2013})


\LHead{{\large Results }}

As an illustration, we report  the partial nonparametric regression plots and results of the significance test for the production function $\widehat{f}(\cdot)$ for the year 2003.

We provide below very preliminary results of the {\color{MonStabilo} distribution of the AR} nonparametrically estimated for each dairy farm each year with a special emphasis on the extreme climatic event year 2003 (in red).\\

To {\color{MonStabilo} conclude}, the distribution of the nonparametric estimation of dairy farmer's risk aversion is significantly higher when an extreme climatic event occurs.
